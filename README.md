# OOP_BookListProject
A simple book list project to explore object oriented JavaScript in ES5 and ES6
<hr>
Use of Event delegation is done in the project
If we have something that is going to show up more than once with the same class and something that is not there when the page loads but it is dynamically added, event delegtaion is used.
